/**
    @brief  This struct contains APIs for calling system functions
            It is basically a jump table. 
            Depending on weather the KERNEL is built or the libs for the app,
            different sys_struct definitions are compiled.
            For Kernel:
                The complete struct with each member is compiled
            For userlib for the app:
                Only a 'const sys_struct* sys' pointer is defined. The address
                of this pointer is made to point to the actual sys_struct in the
                kernel at load time in the LoadApp API
